  This game will attempt to recreate a casino setting with the games BlackJack and Tecas Hold'Em. This will most likely be a three person
casino in which one Player is the user and the other two are computers. The game will follwo the same rules of the games aforementione
and include betting systems. Furthermore, chance and probability play a big role in the game just as does in real life and we hope to
properly work that into our gameplay.

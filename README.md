Final Project
  This game will attempt to recreate a casino setting with the games BlackJack and Texas Hold'Em. This will most likely be a three person
casino in which one Player is the user and the other two are computers. The game will follow the same rules of the games aforementioned
and include betting systems. Furthermore, chance and probability play a big role in the game just as does in real life and we hope to
properly work that into our gameplay. Our betting system consists of bets and folds in which the player is prompted to pick and shall
they choose to fold, they bow out of the game and lose all that they bet.
